# WashU_SP2020.CSE511A_Introduction-to-Artifitial-Intelligence

**Overview**: The discipline of artificial intelligence (AI) is concerned with building systems that think and act like humans or rationally on some absolute scale. This course is an introduction to the field, with special emphasis on sound modern methods. The topics include knowledge representation, problem solving via search, game playing, logical and probabilistic reasoning, planning, machine learning (decision trees, neural nets, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms) and machine vision. Programming exercises will concretize the key methods.
